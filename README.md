# PclComp

Classic tool from the 80&#39;s for compressing print data for PCL printers.  I&#39;m the original author of this code.  I wrote it while developing printer firmware at HP as a testing tool for the firmware.
I released it to the public for the purpose of allowing printer driver developers to use the compression code for supporting compression in PCL printers.  This was when software packages needed to have their own drivers for every printer model they supported, that is, before Windows GDI came along.
